name: Hack quality gate

# You were probably wondering, why there are "quality-gate" jobs littered all over
# our workflows. The reason is, that we want GitHub's automerge to wait for all
# triggered checks to pass. Unfortunately we found only one way, where we need to
# specify the name of the required job. So we introduced a "quality-gate" job,
# that waits for all jobs of the workflow.
# This workflow is for PRs to be mergable if there are no other workflows triggered.
# If you know of a better way we would be very glad to know it, too. üôè
